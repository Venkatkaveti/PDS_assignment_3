I worked with a dataset of tweets that were extracted from Twitter. The data is contained within the "Raw Data" folder in the Assignment-3 directory and includes information on the sentiment of the tweets. The readme file explains the various columns in the dataset. The "results" folder contains images generated as a result of the data analysis. The "src" folder contains the source code used in the analysis.
